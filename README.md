#### Difference save  vs persist 
: Actually the difference between hibernate save() and persist() methods is depends on generator class we are using.
- If our generator class is assigned, then there is no difference between save() and persist() methods.
  Because generator ‘assigned’ means, as  a programmer we need to give the primary key value to save in the database right 
- In case of other than assigned generator class, suppose if our generator class name is Increment means hibernate 
   itself will assign the primary key id value into the database.
   so in this case if we call save() or persist() method then it will insert the record into the database normally   
- other than assigned generator, hibernate only used to take care the primary key id value remember.
- save() method can return that primary key id value which is generated by hibernate and 
  here return type is serializable we can see it by 
	`long s = session.save(k);  `
  persist() will never give any value back to the client, it return type is void 
  
- persist() is JPA method and available in hibernate like other JPA implementaions
  but save() is native hibernate method , it's  `not` available in other JPA implementaions . 
  
- using save() method we can save object within and outside the trnsaction boundries means work even out of transaction	boundry
- but persist() will not work out of transaction boundary ,it can save object within transaction boundries .
  
- save() operation cascades the associated instances if the association is mapped with ` cascade="save-update"`
- persist() operation cascades the associated instances if the association is mapped with ` cascade="persist"`
